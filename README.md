# Weakly Supervised Class-specific Mask Network (WSCMN)
WSCMN mainly has two distinctive properties: i) It exploits the relations among regions to generate community instances, which contain context information and are robust to object variations. ii) It generates class-specific masks for instances and utilizes these masks to dynamically select the most useful instances for recognizing specific objects.
